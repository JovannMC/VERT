VERT is a file conversion utility for the web that uses WebAssembly to convert files directly on your device instead of on a cloud. Check out the live instance at [vert.sh](https://vert.sh).

VERT is built with Svelte & TypeScript (using [bun](https://bun.sh)).

## Development

-   Clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/not-nullptr/VERT.git`
-   Use [bun](https://bun.sh) to install the dependencies - `bun install`
-   Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env` and make any changes (if wanted)
-   Start a dev environment & make your changes - `bun run dev`
-   Build and preview for production - `bun run build` & `bun run preview`
